AME refers to the average marginal effect of sibling death(s); in the woman-level models, it is computed at age 49. All models include survey indicators. Woman-level models also include indicators for the woman's age in single years. Sampling weights are rescaled to reflect each survey's contribution to the sample.}

Point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals based on women-level logit regressions of any under-5 child death on any under-5 sibling death. All regressions include survey indicators and single-year age indicators. Pooled estimations include women of all ages; age-specific estimations are separate for each five-year age group. Average marginal effects are computed for the final age in each age interval; confidence intervals are based on standard errors computed using the delta method.

\footnotesize{Note: This figure reports the impact of simulated measurement error on our mortality persistence estimates. We simulate the omission of reported deceased siblings for different probabilities of omission. For each positive probability, we draw the number of omitted deceased siblings from a binomial distribution 50 times. We estimate each regression from Table \ref{table:main} in each simulated dataset. We plot the mean exponentiated coefficient (odds ratio or incidence rate ratio) across the 50 draws. At p = 0, we plot the result from Table \ref{table:main}, with no simulated measurement error.}

\footnotesize{Note: Each ray from the origin specifies the relationship between the marginal effect and the odds ratio for a binary risk factor (e.g., any sibling death) at a given level of baseline mortality risk. At higher baseline mortality risk, a given odds ratio translates to a larger marginal effect. The mortality decline trajectories demonstrate possible paths for the odds ratio and marginal effect as mortality falls.}
